# DA6233-2023
This is working after is reworking after a lot of times, consider as useful and original.

Today I have tested this and finally working(Commit,pull and push), good for next class.

class 1.
# getwd()- to get the working dir.
# ctrl+l- to clear.

# Quarto document(Document Format).


Yet another markup language(YAML)(Title, Author, format and editor)

mark down(the language of the web)

Heading Style:

H1 TO H6( #- H1 TO ######- H6)

print vs echo:

#Echo: is used to don't show the code - print only output.

# code chunk: its like adding new box to run the R code.

#Render the file: it is used to generate the HTML.

#Cntr+shift+enter- run the whole chunk.

# commenting:

Hash is used to comment- #.

1.is used to print the echo for print the code -#|
2.is used to print the eval not to instal the package again and again(avodi multiple installation) -#|

# calling library:

Load the library tidyverse by calling 'library()' function.
library(package name)


#Dataframe(table):

######mpg is a dataframe from ggplot2 package which we have installed from tidyverse.

# pandas(panel data analysis- use a API) in python is getting replaced with polar(dataframe).


head- top 6 rows
tail- last 6 rows
print- to print and use the dataframe.

dataframe- has vector(identical datatype and length of the rows for merging to table is required), it is usally of matrix form.- this condition is same for pandas and polar dataframe as well.

** how to impute the missing value replacing missing values in R is N/A(counted as data) and in python it is NULL.
